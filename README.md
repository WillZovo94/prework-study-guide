# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation of this project is to help with studying the beginning steps of becoming a developer! I built this project because I figured a interactive console, along with visual notes will help benefit those who are trying to learn coding and programming. It solves the issue of having a study guide at the click of your fingertips. This project helped me learn how to make a structure, styling, and interactive web page. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was also a key factor in the introduction to using GitHub and interacting with Git in general!
